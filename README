Client Event Tracker module allows tracking client-side events with Sitecore Analytics. 

After installing the module, you'll be able to track external file downloads, Ajax events and any kind of visitor interaction that does not cause the page to refresh (expanding / collapsing page areas, popup windows, etc.). Read more about the module here: http://sitecoresnippets.blogspot.com/2011/09/client-side-event-tracking-with.html. 

Note: Client Event Tracker has been tested with Sitecore 6.4.1, but should work with earlier releases as well. Version that supports Sitecore 6.5 and DMS 2.0 will be added later.
